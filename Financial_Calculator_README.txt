In this project, you will create a very simple financial calculator using JavaFX. You will write a Java
program that computes the future value of an investment at a given interest rate for a specified number
of years according to the formula below:

Future Value = Investment Amount * (1 + Monthly Interest Rate) Years * 12

Where Monthly Interest Rate = Annual Interest Rate / 1200

Below is a screenshot of a sample output (PLEASE make sure you get the same result)
