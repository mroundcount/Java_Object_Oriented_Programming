Stopwatch Project
Create a class that represents a stop watch which includes the following:
	Private data fields startClock and endClock with get methods for each
	A no-argument constructor which initializes startClock with the current time
	A method named start_timer() which resets the startClock to the current time
	A method named stop_timer() which sets the endClock to the current time
	A method called getElapsed() which returns the elapsed time in milliseconds
You are required to test your program in measuring the execution time of sorting 10000 numbers using
bubble sort.

NOTE: The program does not have any user input. You will lose points if your program asks the user to
input any data via the keyboard
